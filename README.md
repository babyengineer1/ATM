# ATM
 ATM Code
 
**ATM Code in JavaScript**
It is a simple implementation of an ATM code system using JavaScript programming language. The program prompts users to input their ATM code and verifies if it matches the stored code.
Getting Started
You need a text editor and a web browser installed on your computer to use this program. You can download and install any text editor, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom, and a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

**How to Run the Program** \n

Open the text editor and create a new file.
Copy and paste the JavaScript code into the file.
Save the file with a ".js" extension, for example, "atm-code.js".
Open the file in a web browser.

**How to Use the Program** \n

When you run the program, a prompt asks you to enter your ATM code.
Input your code and press Enter.
The program will then compare the input code to the stored code.
The program will display a success message if the input code matches the stored code.
The program will display an error message if the input code does not match the stored code.

**Security Considerations** \n

This program is just a basic implementation of an ATM code system and should not be used for real-world applications. When building a more sophisticated ATM code system, it is important to consider security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts. Some security measures include:
Hashing and salting the stored code to prevent it from being easily decrypted.
Limiting the number of attempts allowed to enter the code.
Implementing two-factor authentication for added security.
Regularly monitor and audit the system for vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.
